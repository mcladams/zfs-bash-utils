HOST pve20 config   /var/lib/lxc/101/config
not directly edited but has copied changes to container conf
NOTE: mountpoint is made for coainer at /var/lib/lxc/101/rootfs

CONTAINER CT-ID config    /etc/pve/lxc/101.conf   added before first start:
lxc.apparmor_profile: unconfined
lxc.mount.auto: cgroup:rw
lxc.mount.auto: proc:rw
lxc.mount.auto: sys:rw

added later to make disk/partition device files, in this example from
root@pve20:~# ll /dev/sdf*
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 0, 0 Sep 21 21:45 /dev/sdf
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 0, 0 Sep 21 21:45 /dev/sdf1
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 0, 0 Sep 21 21:45 /dev/sdf9

we make mounts allowed in the container /etc/pve/lxc/101.conf
lxc.cgroup.devices.allow: b 8:80 rwm
lxc.cgroup.devices.allow: b 8:81 rwm
lxc.cgroup.devices.allow: b 8:89 rwm
lxc.autodev: 1

we make the mounts in pve host with hook file /var/lib/lxc/101/mount-hook.sh
#! /bin/sh
LXC_ROOTFS_MOUNT=/var/lib/lxc/101/rootfs
mknod -m 777 ${LXC_ROOTFS_MOUNT}/dev/sdf b 8 80
mknod -m 777 ${LXC_ROOTFS_MOUNT}/dev/sdf1 b 8 81
mknod -m 777 ${LXC_ROOTFS_MOUNT}/dev/sdf9 b 8 89

Add any bind mounts (up to 256) we want in the container config /etc/pve/lxc/101.conf
